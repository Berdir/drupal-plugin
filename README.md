About
=====

Plugin selectors allow users to select plugins of a particular type and
configure them using the plugins' configuration forms.

This module is a tool for other modules to build user interfaces. Using plugin
selectors, your users can easily select and configure your plugins and you 
won't have to write any complex form API integration; the plugin selectors will 
do that for you.
